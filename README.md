# CyberEdu
Game building of Cyber security game meant to engage high schooler and college level students in the world of cyber security.

## Topics
- SQL Injection (Hint: )
- Cryptography (Hint: https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher)
- Reverse Engineering 
- Directory Traversal (Hint: https://security.openstack.org/guidelines/dg_using-file-paths.html)

## Requirements
- Python3
- pygames (pip install pygame)

## How to Run
Run python file with the command:
`python Main_menu.py` or `python3 Main_menu.py`

If wanting to challenge yourself with reversable bytecode, unzip dist.zip and run:
`python3 Main_menu.cpython-39`

Once running, either look in source code for TODO hints, or reverse enginer the bytecode.
