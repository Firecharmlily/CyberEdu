## Topics
- SQL Injection (Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp)
- Cryptography (Hint: https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher)
- Reverse Engineering (Hint: Looking at main code counts or decrypting the .py files)
- Directory Traversal (Hint: https://security.openstack.org/guidelines/dg_using-file-paths.html)
- Break Access Control (Hint: https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/crack-password-protected-zip-files-pdfs-more-with-zydra-0207607/ and pass is 3 numeral characters)

## Requirements
- Python3
- pygames (pip install pygame)
- Some python knowledge
- Open Mind

##Recommended Python IDE
- Pycharm

## How to Run
Run python file with the command:
`python Main_menu.py` or `python3 Main_menu.py`

If wanting to challenge yourself with reversable bytecode, unzip dist.zip and run (version is 3.9):
`python3 Main_menu.cpython-39`

Once running, either look in source code for TODO hints, or reverse enginer the bytecode.
